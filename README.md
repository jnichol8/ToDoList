This is a java based todolist that uses swift to create the GUI
This means that you need JAVA 17 to run the JAR file: [JavaSE17](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk17-archive-downloads.html )

once the 3 fields are filled, click the add button to add the task to the todolist
after clicking on a task in the list, you can:
click delete which will delete the task from the list
click complete which will gray it out in the list and mark it as done
fill in the 3 fields with updated informtaion and click edit which will override the current information in the todolist

TODO:
persistent storage/memory
imporove the way editing works
  new window to edit or just make it so that if a field isn't filled it wont overrite what is already there
